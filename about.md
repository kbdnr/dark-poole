## BIO
Kevin Bednar is an experimental sound artist and programmer whose output ranges from ambient soundscapes to mangled percussion.  As a software engineer by trade, Spednar performances are comprised primarily of live-coded concepts using the tidalcycles system.  Other FOSS software such as puredata, DIN is Noise, and other experimental software packages are often known to make appearances.

In 2018, he began developing and performing with a custom software package 'Audiot' along with Danielle Rager. Kevin is a co-founder of Cosmic Sound, a Pittsburgh-based online radio station and event production collective. He has recently helped to create the BXC Collective and Live Code Pittsburgh groups.
