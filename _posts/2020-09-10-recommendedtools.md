## Cross-Platform
- [Tidalcycles](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Welcome) - you are probably on my website because of this suite of software.  a no-brainer for algorithmic music tooling
- [DIN is Noise](https://dinisnoise.org/) - one of the most interesting perspectives on (bezier-)synthesis
- [Automatonism](https://www.automatonism.com/) - an inviting use of Pure Data for modular synthesis
- [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) - avoid spending thousands of dollars

## Windows
- [Virtual Audio Cable](https://vac.muzychenko.net/en/) - not to be confused with VB-Cable! The best option for software routing within the windows ecosystem
- [LoopMidi](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) - required midi loopback for complex and shared system routing
- [Asio4All](http://www.asio4all.org/) - if you have a high latency tolerance, this provides a necessary audio layer within Windows
- [Synchronous Audio Router](http://sar.audio/) - a modern solution to the windows audio routing issue
- [OBS-VirtualCam](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-virtualcam.539/) - a requirement in the quarantine age
- [OBS-Asio](https://github.com/Andersama/obs-asio) - another requirement in the quarantine age - utilize specific asio device channels!

## Linux
- [Carla](https://kx.studio/Applications:Carla) - Amazing audio plugin and routing host.
- [QJackCTL](https://qjackctl.sourceforge.io/) - The best no-frills jack audio management system.  The included patchbay system is criminally underutilized for automating complex routings.
- [Calf Plugins](https://calf-studio-gear.org/) - ultra-fast synths and mastering plugins

## Mac
Preface - I do not own a modern macintosh machine so my experience is limited here.
- [BlackHole](https://existential.audio/blackhole/) - the new competition for macintosh audio routing. prefered to JackPilot

## Plugins/VSTs/etc
- [Suzuki Kentaro Plugins](https://gumroad.com/szk_1992) - Easily some of the best Max4Live utilities around with exceptional UIs
- [Madrona Labs](https://madronalabs.com/) - Kaivo and Aalto have made their way into my regular plugin arsenal
